# Galway-Acccomodation-Finder-Website
A fictional website that went above and beyond the requirements for a school end-of-year project
This website allows students to search through accomodation postings by landlords and get in contact about renting them.
The website was a personal excercise in the following:
->Utilizing databases with SQL and phpMyAdmin
->Accessing databases with mySQL
->Processing logins and accounts with PHP
->Email interactivity with PHP
->Generating and maintaining sessions with PHP
->Generating HTML Web pages that can be dynamically altered with PHP
->Building detailed SQL statements through search forms to display filtered results
->Using Bootstrap and jQuery
